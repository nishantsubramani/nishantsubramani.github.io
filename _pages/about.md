I am a 3rd year PhD student ðŸŽ“ at [CMU](https://cmu.edu) in the [Language Technologies Institute (LTI)](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) advised by [Mona Diab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-y6SIhQAAAAJ&hl=en). I am primarily interested in demystifying language model internals (MechInterp) and operationalizing them (ActionableInterp) to build more responsible, controllable, trustworthy, and efficient NLP systems. I wrote the first papers on steering vectors ([NeurIPS2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04944), [arXiv2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09049), [ACL2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05124)) and worked on open LLM initiatives such as [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo) and [BLOOM](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom) winning multiple [best paper awards](https://2024.aclweb.org/program/best_papers/) and a [GeekWire innovation of the year award](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai-and-telecom-breakthroughs-dominate-innovation-of-the-year-category-for-2024-geekwire-awards/i). 

If you're interested in or actively working on model interpretability especially if you are from an underrepresented group, I'd love to chat and perhaps collaborate and/or mentor, please reach out! 

The past two summers, I interned at the semantic machines team at Microsoft Research and the cloud AI research team at Google working on actionable interpretability. Before CMU, I spent nearly two and a half years as a predoctoral researcher on the AllenNLP team at [AI2](https://allenai.org/), where I worked with [Matt Peters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=K5nCPZwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before that I spent two years in industry at startups as a research scientist working on NLP, vision, speech, and multimodal applications. I have had the opportunity to work closely with some amazing collaborators at other institutions including [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/), [Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/), [Margaret Mitchell](https://www.m-mitchell.com/), [Sasha Luccioni](https://www.sashaluccioni.com/), [Vladlen Koltun](https://vladlen.info/), and [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/).
